# Autonomous AI Agent System

**Purpose of this document**: Enable any third party to fully understand the project vision, decision history, current state, and deliverables without needing to read the full conversation transcript.

**Last updated**: March 11, 2026 (Session 33: Third Outbound Run, Scheduling Decision, Model Assignment)

---

## 1. The Big Picture

### 1.1 Vision

Build a **general-purpose system in which AI agents can think and act independently, cooperate with each other, and operate autonomously** — even while the operator is sleeping. The system should be adaptable to any task domain, not tied to a single use case.

This vision was directly inspired by the article *"I'm good at one thing. So my OpenClaw agent, Marc, automated the other 100 things"*, in which a podcaster built 11 specialized agents coordinated by a COO agent (Marc) that ran an entire podcast production pipeline overnight — from content creation to posting to analytics — all while the operator slept.

### 1.2 What This Is NOT

This is **not** a project to build a specific product (podcast automation, social media tool, etc.). The goal is to establish:

1. **An architectural pattern** for multi-agent autonomous systems
2. **A reusable framework** built on Claude Code + cron + Telegram that can be applied to any task domain
3. **Validated best practices** for agent coordination, error handling, memory persistence, and human-in-the-loop workflows

### 1.3 The Demo Project: X (Twitter) AI Beauty Growth

To validate the architecture in a real-world scenario, the first demonstration project is an autonomous X (Twitter) growth system for AI-generated beauty content. This demo was chosen because it exercises all the core capabilities the framework needs:

| Framework Capability | How the Demo Exercises It |
|---|---|
| Multi-agent coordination | 7 agents with dependency chains (Scout → Strategist → Creator) |
| External API integration | X API v2 for posting, engagement, and metrics |
| Scheduled autonomous operation | Overnight pipeline + distributed daytime posting |
| Human-in-the-loop at decision points | Content approval via Telegram before posting |
| Data-driven strategy adaptation | Daily metrics feed back into next day's strategy |
| Error handling & escalation | API failures, rate limits, anomaly detection |
| Persistent memory across sessions | CLAUDE.md for behavioral rules, SQLite for metrics |
| Reporting & communication | Telegram briefs, reports, alerts, and commands |

The X Beauty demo is a means to an end. The real deliverable is the proven architecture, patterns, and tooling that emerge from building it.

### 1.4 Future Applications

Once the framework is validated through the X Beauty demo, it can be applied to other domains within Shimpei's business interests, potentially including:

- AI content monetization across multiple platforms
- Automated market research and competitive intelligence
- Business operations automation for Amarry Technologies
- Any domain requiring coordinated autonomous agents

---

## 2. Who Is Building This

**Shimpei** — Founder & CEO of Amarry Technologies Inc. (Delaware C-Corporation, incorporated October 2025). He is a 31-year-old Japanese national based in Japan (currently in Kagoshima). The company is building UniModel, an AI model marketplace and intelligent routing system. This autonomous agent system is being developed to explore AI-driven automation capabilities and validate agent architectures that can be applied across the business.

**Key constraints**:
- Solo operator — no team, no co-founder
- Available ~1 hour/day for the demo project (7-9 AM JST morning window)
- Based in Japan (JST timezone), which affects pipeline scheduling
- Budget-conscious — prefers cost-efficient solutions over premium ones
- Has experience with prompt engineering, Claude Code, and AI tool evaluation

## 3. Conversation Timeline & Decision Log

The conversation spanned from **February 28, 2026 (04:00 UTC)** to **March 1, 2026 (~06:00 UTC)** across multiple sessions. The first three sessions focused on the general autonomous agent architecture. The remaining sessions applied that architecture to the X Beauty demo.

---

### Phase A: General Architecture Research

#### Session 1: Article Analysis & Framework Comparison (Feb 28, 04:00-04:40 UTC)

**Trigger**: Shimpei shared the OpenClaw article and stated his core intent clearly:

> *"I would like to build a system in which agents can act independently and cooperate with each other to suit my own tasks. I'm not trying to build the specific agents that are built in the article."*

He wanted to use Claude Code instead of OpenClaw, and asked for a clear analysis of what Claude Code can and cannot do.

**Key analysis delivered**:

8 core architectural principles were extracted from the article as framework-agnostic patterns:

1. **Single-responsibility agents** — each agent does one thing well
2. **Hierarchical coordination** — a COO agent orchestrates all others
3. **Cron-based scheduling** — time-triggered execution for overnight pipelines
4. **Persistent memory** — agents retain knowledge across sessions
5. **Skill files** — reusable instruction sets that define agent behavior
6. **Error compounding awareness** — upstream failures cascade; must be handled
7. **Human-in-the-loop** — human approval at critical decision points
8. **Messaging-based communication** — real-time reporting via Telegram/WhatsApp/Slack

Feature-by-feature comparison of Claude Code vs OpenClaw across 7 categories:

| Capability | Claude Code | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduled execution | ⚠️ Needs OS cron | ✅ Built-in daemon |
| Multi-agent coordination | ✅ Subagents + orchestrator script | ✅ Native multi-agent |
| Persistent memory | ✅ CLAUDE.md (native) + filesystem | ✅ Built-in state management |
| Skill files | ✅ Markdown-based skill system | ✅ Native skill system |
| External tool integration | ✅ Full bash/Python access | ✅ Built-in tool framework |
| Error handling | ⚠️ Must build in orchestrator | ✅ Built-in error handling |
| Always-on operation | ❌ Session-based (needs cron) | ✅ Daemon-based |
| Messaging channels | ❌ Must build custom bot | ✅ Native Telegram/WhatsApp/Slack |

**Core finding**: Claude Code handles ~80% of requirements natively. The two gaps are:
- **Scheduled execution**: Claude Code is a CLI tool (starts → executes → exits). It needs an external trigger (cron, GitHub Actions) to run at 2 AM.
- **Messaging channels**: No native Telegram/WhatsApp integration. Requires a custom Python bot (~50-100 lines).

**Decision 1**: Claude Code + cron is sufficient for the autonomous agent framework. OpenClaw is unnecessary.

**Deliverable**: `autonomous-agent-system-analysis.md`

#### Session 2: Infrastructure & Scheduling Deep Dive (Feb 28, 04:37-05:00 UTC)

**Shimpei's follow-up questions**:

1. *"Why is a Mac Mini necessary?"*

   Answer: It's not specifically a Mac Mini — any always-on compute works. The core issue is that **something must be awake at 2 AM to trigger the agents**. Claude Code is not a daemon; if the operator's laptop is closed, nothing runs.

   | Option | Cost | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | Mac Mini | ~$600 one-time | Physical device, needs power/internet |
   | VPS (Hetzner, Vultr) | $5-20/month | Cloud, no physical hardware |
   | GitHub Actions | Free (2,000 min/month) | No server at all |

2. *"Are there issues with OS cron?"*

   Cron itself is reliable (50-year-old tech). The concerns are Claude Code-specific:
   - **`--dangerously-skip-permissions`**: Required for unattended execution (no human to click "approve" at 2 AM). Means agent can execute any command.
   - **No native dependency chains**: If Agent A fails, cron still fires Agent B at its scheduled time. Mitigated by an orchestrator script that runs agents sequentially with error checking.
   - **No built-in alerting**: Cron doesn't notify on failure. Mitigated by Telegram notifications from the orchestrator.
   - **Session isolation**: Each `claude -p` call is a fresh session. Agents communicate via shared filesystem (JSON, SQLite), not in-memory state.

**Decision 2**: Use VPS for always-on compute. Use cron with an orchestrator shell script for dependency management.

#### Session 3: Messaging Integration (Feb 28, 13:00 UTC)

**Shimpei's question** (in Japanese): "If not using OpenClaw, do I need to develop a custom solution for Telegram/WhatsApp messaging?"

**Answer**: Yes, but it's far simpler than expected:
- **Telegram Bot**: ~50-100 lines Python using `python-telegram-bot` + Anthropic SDK. Free. Full-featured.
- **WhatsApp**: Much harder — requires Meta Business account, review process, monthly fees, or unofficial libraries with BAN risk.

**Decision 3**: Use Telegram Bot for all human-agent communication. Skip WhatsApp.

**Architecture pattern established**:
```
cron → claude -p (batch pipeline) → results to filesystem
Telegram Bot (always-on Python daemon) → receives human messages → Claude API → responds
```

This pattern is framework-agnostic — it works for any task domain, not just X Beauty.

---

### Phase B: Demo Project — X (Twitter) AI Beauty Growth

#### Session 4: Demo Project Design (Feb 28, 16:20-16:40 UTC)

**Shimpei's request**: "As a demonstration, let's build an agent that can autonomously operate X. Specifically, AI Beauty theme. Start from scratch, gain 10,000 followers as quickly as possible."

This was explicitly framed as a demonstration — a real-world test of the autonomous agent architecture.

**Clarification Q&A**:

| Question | Shimpei's Answer |
|---|---|
| X API access? | No API — use browser automation (Playwright) |
| Post language? | Create both EN and JP accounts, A/B test which works better |
| Outbound automation risk tolerance? | Accept BAN risk, automate fully |
| Posts per day? | 3-5 (standard) |
| Media type? | Static AI images only (no video) |
| Competitor accounts? | Already has benchmark candidates |

**Design delivered**: 6-agent system (Scout, Strategist, Creator, Publisher, Analyst, Commander) applying all 8 architectural principles from the framework research. Later expanded to 7 agents (Session 30: Outbound extracted from Publisher). Included pipeline schedule, shared state architecture, and 5-phase implementation plan.

**Deliverable**: `x-ai-beauty-agent-config.md` (v1.0)

#### Session 5: COO Agent & X API Pivot (Mar 1, 02:50 UTC)

**Shimpei raised two issues**:

1. **Missing COO agent**: The v1.0 design had a "Commander" that only reported — it didn't orchestrate. Shimpei correctly identified this: *"In the article, Marc (COO) coordinates agents, holds meetings, and reports to me."* The COO pattern from the original article — the architectural principle of hierarchical coordination — was not properly implemented.

2. **X API preference**: *"If it's possible to do it officially via X API, that would be better than Playwright."* This reversed the initial browser automation approach.

**X API research conducted**:
- Free: $0 (write-only, 500 posts/month)
- Basic: $200/month (15K reads, 50K writes)
- Pro: $5,000/month (1M reads, full metrics including impressions)
- Enterprise: $42,000+/month

**Critical limitation**: Basic plan only provides `public_metrics` (likes, RTs, replies). Impression counts require `non_public_metrics` at Pro ($5,000/month).

**Decision 4**: Hybrid strategy — X API for all operations + Playwright only for impression scraping from own account pages. $200/month with near-zero BAN risk.

**Decision 5**: Add Marc (COO) as a true orchestrator — pipeline control, War Room reviews, error handling, Telegram commands, daily retrospectives. This properly implements the hierarchical coordination principle.

**Deliverable**: `x-ai-beauty-agent-config-v2.0-en.md`

#### Session 6: Reporter Merge & Architecture Refinement (Mar 1, 03:45-04:30 UTC)

**Shimpei's argument**: Marc should own reporting, not delegate it to a separate Reporter agent. His reasoning: *"The article states that the COO is also creating the report. Marc has the full context from orchestration."*

**Analysis**: Correct. A separate Reporter is an unnecessary indirection. The value of a status report is judgment — what to highlight, what to deprioritize, what decisions to escalate. That judgment comes from orchestration context that only the COO holds. A separate Reporter would need the same context re-loaded, producing worse output at additional cost. Reporting is the communication layer of orchestration, not a separate domain.

**Decision 6**: Merge Reporter into Marc. Agent count: 7 → 6.

**Language fix**: Claude had been responding in Japanese since one early Japanese message. Shimpei corrected this.

**Decision 7**: Documents in English with JP market-specific terms preserved in 日本語.

**Deliverable**: `x-ai-beauty-agent-config-v2.1-en.md`

#### Session 7: CLAUDE.md Memory Integration (Mar 1, ~05:00 UTC)

**Shimpei's input**: Pointed out that Claude Code has built-in memory functionality via CLAUDE.md files, providing documentation link.

**Key finding**: Claude Code's CLAUDE.md provides a 4-tier hierarchy (enterprise → project → user → local) with auto-loading at launch and `@path` import syntax. This directly addresses the "persistent memory" principle from the framework research.

**Impact on the general framework pattern**:
- Agent instructions can be auto-loaded via CLAUDE.md imports (no manual `cat` commands)
- Behavioral rules learned from errors persist across sessions automatically
- Structured data stays in JSON/SQLite for Python scripts
- **This is a reusable pattern**: any future project using this framework gets the same memory architecture

**Decision 8**: CLAUDE.md for behavioral instructions; JSON/SQLite for machine-parseable data. No duplication.

#### Session 8: Specification & PRD (Mar 1, ~05:30 UTC)

**Shimpei's request**: Create proper specification and PRD documents for the demo project.

**Decision 9**: Treat the existing config document as the Technical Specification (updated to v2.2 with 7 new sections covering auth, config schemas, cron definitions, env vars, memory architecture, testing, and deployment). Create a separate PRD covering the product layer.

**Deliverables**: `specs/x-ai-beauty-spec-v2.3.md` + `specs/x-ai-beauty-prd-v1.md`

#### Session 9: Agent Design Principles & Phase 0 Runbook (Mar 1-2, ~15:00-02:00 UTC)

**Shimpei's input**: Shared "Lessons from Building Claude Code: Seeing like an Agent" article with 6 core principles for building effective AI agents.

**Principles integrated**: (1) Minimal tool count per agent — tool assignment table created, (2) Structured elicitation over free text — Telegram command interface, (3) Task-based subagent coordination — `pipeline_state_{date}.json` replaces rigid sequences, (4) Progressive disclosure — agents discover context incrementally, (5) Revisit tool assumptions weekly, (6) Add capabilities without adding tools.

**Impact**: Spec updated to v2.3 (Section 14: Agent Design Principles, Section 13.5: Progressive Disclosure). PRD Section 7 added.

**Blocking decisions resolved**:
- **OQ-3**: Use existing X accounts (not fresh ones)
- **OQ-6**: Vultr Tokyo VPS ($12/mo) — selected for JST timezone proximity
- **OQ-7**: Claude Max subscription ($100/mo)

**Phase 0 Runbook created**: 12-step VPS-based environment setup guide (later revised in Session 10).

**File cleanup**: 10 files reduced to 5 — all superseded config versions deleted.

#### Session 10: Local-First Development & Compliance Review (Mar 2, ~02:00+ UTC)

**Shimpei's key insight**: VPS is only needed for autonomous operation — not during development. During development, you sit at your own machine and trigger agents from the CLI. VPS deployment should be deferred to when all agents are proven reliable.

**Decision 10**: Local-first development. Phases 0-4 run on your own machine (CLI). VPS provisioning moves to Phase 6. Autonomous cron operation is Phase 7.

**Phase 0 Runbook rewritten**: Completely replaced VPS-centric 12-step guide with local development setup (9 steps). No server provisioning, hardening, or cron setup.

**Implementation phases restructured**: 5 phases → 7 phases:
- Phases 0-4: Your machine (build, test, iterate)
- Phase 5: Claude hybrid agent conversion (Analyst, Scout, Publisher intelligence)
- Phase 6: VPS deployment (provision, copy project, install cron)
- Phase 7: Autonomous operation (cron triggers agents overnight)

**X Developer Terms compliance review**: Full review of Developer Agreement, Developer Policy, and Automation Rules against our project design.

**Decision 11**: Record compliance concerns without making spec changes — review each issue during the relevant implementation phase.

**7 issues identified**:
- 🔴 Automated likes prohibited (Phase 3)
- 🔴 Automated follows risk bulk/aggressive violation (Phase 3)
- 🔴 Cold outbound replies require prior user interaction (Phase 3)
- 🔴 Playwright scraping is banned non-API automation (Phase 4)
- 🟡 Bot account labeling required (Phase 0/3)
- 🟡 Cross-account content must be genuinely unique (Phase 2)
- 🟡 Use case description is binding (Phase 0)

**Deliverable**: `specs/x-developer-terms-compliance-review.md`

#### Session 11: Phase 0 Execution & GitHub Setup (Mar 3, ~00:00+ UTC)

**Phase 0 runbook executed**: All 9 steps completed successfully. 30/30 health check passed — CLI tools, X API credentials, Telegram bot, project directory structure, CLAUDE.md hierarchy, and config files all verified working.

**Git initialization**: Repository initialized with comprehensive `.gitignore` excluding secrets (`config/accounts.json`, `.env`, `*.sqlite`, etc.). `accounts.example.json` template created for safe credential sharing.

**GitHub repository created**: `https://github.com/Shimpeioto/X-agents` (private). Initial commit pushed with full project structure. Phase 0 is now complete and version-controlled.

**Decision 13**: Initialize git and push to GitHub at Phase 0 completion — establishes version control before any agent development begins.

#### Session 12: Phase 1 Specification & PRD (Mar 3, 2026)

**Phase 1 Spec and PRD written**: Full technical specification and product requirements for Phase 1 (Scout + Strategist + Marc Foundation).

**Key architecture decision — Marc-as-Claude agent**:

The original parent spec assumed a Python orchestrator script (`run_pipeline.py`) would sequence agents. This was rearchitected: Marc is now a **Claude agent** invoked via `scripts/run_pipeline.sh` (thin shell wrapper), with `scripts/validate.py` providing deterministic validation as a feedback loop.

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `scripts/run_pipeline.sh` | Thin shell wrapper — sets date, checks `.pipeline.lock`, invokes `claude -p` with Marc's skill file |
| `agents/marc.md` | Marc's full instruction set — orchestration logic, sequencing, error recovery, semantic cross-validation |
| `scripts/validate.py` | Deterministic pass/fail validation (scout, strategist, cross modes) — Marc calls this via bash tool |

**Rationale**: Orchestration involves judgment (error recovery, cross-validation reasoning, adaptive retry prompts) — Claude's strength. Deterministic checks (schema validation, field presence, data bounds) stay in Python. This avoids a Phase 2 rewrite since the parent spec already defines Marc as a Claude agent in all cron jobs.

**Decision 14**: Marc implemented as a Claude agent (`agents/marc.md`) with `scripts/validate.py` for deterministic validation and `scripts/run_pipeline.sh` as the entry point. Replaces the originally-assumed Python orchestrator script.

**Decision 15**: Strategist writes only the dated file (`strategy_{YYYYMMDD}.json`). Marc copies to `strategy_current.json` only after all validations pass — preventing unvalidated data from corrupting the current strategy.

**Parent docs updated for consistency**:
- Parent spec (`x-ai-beauty-spec-v2.3.md`): project structure updated, Section 11.2 annotated as Phase 6+, locking recommendation extended, Phase 6 checklist annotated
- Parent PRD (`x-ai-beauty-prd-v1.md`): F7 note updated to link Phase 1 spec
- Review doc (`review.md`): Issues 3.15 and 3.16 annotated with Phase 1 resolution status

**Self-review found and fixed 10 issues** (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 6 LOW):
- **HIGH**: `strategy_current.json` write conflict (Strategist vs Marc) — resolved: Marc is sole writer after validation
- **HIGH**: Strategist invocation mechanism ambiguous (`$(cat)` vs progressive disclosure) — resolved: standardized on progressive disclosure
- **MEDIUM**: `run_pipeline.sh` missing `.pipeline.lock` implementation — added
- **MEDIUM**: `competitors.json` schema missing — added cross-reference to parent spec Section 10.2
- **LOW**: Date format conversion undocumented, hardcoded competitor counts, `--dry-run` undefined, Scout output path convention, Phase 0 prerequisite missing from PRD, `--dangerously-skip-permissions` security note missing — all fixed

**Deliverables**: `specs/phase-1-spec.md` (v1.0) + `specs/phase-1-prd.md` (v1.0)

#### Session 20: Architecture Review & Agent Building Guidelines (Mar 5, 2026)

**Post-Phase 4 architecture documentation sprint**: With all 6 agents implemented and tested through Phase 4, codified the implicit patterns into explicit documentation.

**Architecture Review** (completed before this session):
- Split `marc.md` (~400+ lines) into hub + 3 reference files following Progressive Disclosure principle: `marc.md` (hub, ~131 lines), `marc_pipeline.md` (Steps 1-13, ~201 lines), `marc_publishing.md` (Steps P1-P8, ~138 lines), `marc_schemas.md` (schemas & formats, ~140 lines)
- Added metadata comment headers to all 9 agent files (name, role, invocation, modes, inputs, outputs, dependencies)
- Created `docs/harness.md` — Three-layer architecture model (Shell → Marc → Specialists), OS analogy (Schmid 2026), 5 key patterns (Validation-First, H3 Retry, Human Gating, State Machine, Progressive Disclosure), file layout reference

**Agent Building Guidelines** (this session):
- Created `docs/guides/agent-building-guidelines.md` (~1000 lines) — comprehensive guide for building new agents
- 10 sections: Principles (8), Decision Framework, Agent Anatomy (template included), Script Companion (Python template), I/O Contract (file naming, data flow map), Orchestration Integration (5 registration locations), Validation & Error Handling (7 check levels, H3 protocol), Testing (6-step pipeline testing sequence), New Agent Checklist, References (7 articles)
- Updated `docs/harness.md` with "Related Documentation" link to the guide
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` Documentation section with guide reference

**Deliverables**: `docs/guides/agent-building-guidelines.md`, updated `docs/harness.md`, updated `CLAUDE.md`

#### Session 21: Phase 5 Spec & PRD — Claude Hybrid Agent Conversion (Mar 5, 2026)

**Deep exploration of all three Python-only agents** (Scout, Publisher, Analyst) to identify where Claude reasoning adds value vs. where Python should stay.

**Scout analysis**: Found 36.9% reply contamination (151/409 sampled tweets are @replies), hardcoded trending threshold (`like_count >= 100`) returns zero results, 59 unfiltered new accounts mixing bots with 200K-follower accounts, impression data collected but never used, 92.7% of competitors use zero hashtags.

**Publisher analysis**: `random.choice(reply_templates)` with no semantic matching, always targets `recent_tweets[0]` regardless of content, no relevance filtering, identical error logging for all failure types.

**Analyst analysis**: Zero interpretation layer — computes only `hours_after_post`, `engagement_rate` (always NULL from API), and `followers_change`. Marc manually owns anomaly detection, report composition, and A/B test evaluation in Step P8.

**Approved conversion plan** — "Claude Brain, Python Hands":
- Analyst Intelligence Mode: Claude reads raw metrics, detects anomalies, composes daily report. Python collect/summary/import unchanged.
- Scout Intelligence Mode: Claude runs `scout.py --raw --compact`, analyzes compact output (457KB→30KB), writes enriched report with `analysis` section (backward compatible).
- Publisher Smart Outbound Mode: Claude reads target tweets via new `publisher_outbound_data.py`, selects relevant tweets, crafts contextual replies, writes outbound plan. New `smart-outbound` subcommand executes plan. Post subcommand unchanged.
- All three have fallback to Phase 4 behavior if Claude fails.

**Phase renumbering**: Phase 5 = Claude Hybrid Agent Conversion, Phase 6 = VPS Deployment (was 5), Phase 7 = Autonomous Operation (was 6). Total phases: 7.

**Deliverables**: `docs/specs/phase-5-spec.md` (1456 lines), `docs/specs/phase-5-prd.md` (258 lines), updated `docs/context.md`

#### Session 22: Phase 5 Implementation — Claude Hybrid Agent Conversion (Mar 5, 2026)

**Implemented all three sub-phases** of the "Claude Brain, Python Hands" hybrid agent conversion:

**Sub-Phase 1 — Analyst Intelligence**:
- `agents/analyst.md` — Added "Intelligence Mode" section (Steps 1-4: read inputs, analyze per account, outbound effectiveness, compose report)
- `scripts/validate.py` — Added `validate_analyst_report()` (8 checks), `validate_scout_analysis()` (6 checks), `validate_outbound_plan()` (7 checks) + CLI routing for all three
- `agents/marc_publishing.md` — Replaced Step P8 with P8a (Claude subagent) → P8b (validate) → P8c (send report + alerts via Telegram)

**Sub-Phase 2 — Scout Intelligence**:
- `scripts/scout.py` — Added `--raw`/`--compact` CLI flags, `compute_pre_analysis()` (reply contamination, impression engagement, dynamic trending threshold, hashtag usage), `compact_report()` (457KB→~30KB)
- `agents/scout.md` — Added "Daily Intelligence Mode" section (Steps 1-3: collect raw+compact, analyze using _pre_analysis stats, write enriched backward-compatible report)
- `agents/marc_pipeline.md` — Replaced Step 2 with Claude Scout subagent invocation + H3 retry + fallback to plain `python3 scripts/scout.py`

**Sub-Phase 3 — Publisher Smart Outbound**:
- `scripts/publisher_outbound_data.py` — **New file** (~120 lines): `OutboundDataFetcher` class, fetches target account info + 5 recent tweets, JSON output to stdout
- `scripts/publisher.py` — Added `run_smart_outbound()` function + `smart-outbound` CLI subcommand (reads Claude-generated plan, executes with same rate limits/delays)
- `agents/publisher.md` — Added "Smart Outbound Mode" section (Steps 1-4: read inputs, fetch target data, analyze and plan, write outbound plan)
- `agents/marc_publishing.md` — Replaced Step P4 with P4a (Claude subagent generates plan) → P4b (validate) → P4c (publisher.py smart-outbound executes) + fallback to legacy outbound

**Files modified** (9): `agents/analyst.md`, `agents/scout.md`, `agents/publisher.md`, `agents/marc_pipeline.md`, `agents/marc_publishing.md`, `scripts/scout.py`, `scripts/publisher.py`, `scripts/validate.py`, `docs/context.md`
**Files created** (1): `scripts/publisher_outbound_data.py`
**Files unchanged** (as designed): `scripts/analyst.py` — Python collect/summary/import stays as-is

**Deliverables**: All code changes per `docs/specs/phase-5-spec.md` §5.1-5.9.

---

### Session 23 — Phase 5 E2E Testing: 20-Test Battery Complete (March 5, 2026)

**Goal**: Execute the full 20-test E2E battery defined in `docs/specs/phase-5-spec.md` §8, validating all Phase 5 Claude hybrid agent conversions end-to-end.

**Test Phases**:
- **Phase A (Dry-Run / Script-Level)**: Tests 8, 15, 16 — Scout `--raw --compact` produces 15KB compact file with `_pre_analysis`, publisher rate limits enforced correctly, legacy outbound fallback works
- **Phase B (API-Level)**: Test 12 — `publisher_outbound_data.py` fetches real target data, returns valid JSON with user info + recent tweets
- **Phase C (Claude Subagent Intelligence)**: Tests 1-7, 9-11, 13-14, 17 — All Claude intelligence modes verified (Analyst Intelligence, Scout Intelligence, Publisher Smart Outbound), validators accept enriched outputs, cross-check passes
- **Phase D (Full E2E Pipeline)**: Tests 18-20 — Full pipeline with Claude subagents, live posting (8 tweets: 4 EN + 4 JP, Day 2), fallback resilience confirmed

**Issues Found & Resolved**:
- Schema drift between Claude output and `validate.py` — validators updated to accept both `string` and `null` for optional fields (`anomaly_detail`, `reasoning`)
- Null handling in outbound plans — `validate_outbound_plan` relaxed to accept `null` for optional `reply_to` and `reasoning` fields when target is skipped
- X API 402 (Payment Required) during testing — intermittent, resolved on retry

**Test Artifacts Created**:
- `scripts/run_phase5_tests.sh` — Phase A+B test runner
- `scripts/run_phase5_tests_c.sh` — Phase C test runner (Claude subagents)
- `scripts/run_phase5_tests_d.sh` — Phase D test runner (full E2E + live posting)
- `data/scout_report_enriched_test.json` — Fixture for Claude intelligence tests
- `data/scout_report_fallback_test.json` — Fixture for fallback resilience tests
- `data/strategy_fallback_test.json` — Fixture for fallback testing
- `data/strategy_test_enriched.json` — Fixture for enriched strategy testing

**Live Posts**: 4 EN + 4 JP tweets posted successfully (Day 2, March 5, 2026)

**Result**: **20/20 PASS** — All tests passed. Phase 5 complete.

### Session 24 — Agent Teams Migration: Conversational Marc + Teammate Architecture (March 5, 2026)

**Goal**: Migrate from pipeline-driven subagent architecture (`claude -p` isolated subagents) to Claude Code Agent Teams with a two-layer conversational architecture.

**Architecture Change**:
- **Before**: Shell scripts → `claude -p` Marc → nested `claude -p` subagents (isolated, no coordination)
- **After**: Telegram → Conversational Marc (`claude -p`, lightweight) → Execution Layer (Agent Teams: Marc as Team Leader, teammates with shared task list + messaging)

**Two-Layer Design**:
- **Conversational Layer**: Marc receives Telegram messages via `claude -p`, reasons about them, asks clarifying questions, decides when to execute. Uses `START_TASK:` JSON marker to signal task execution.
- **Execution Layer**: Claude Code Agent Teams — Marc spawns teammates (Scout, Strategist, Creator, Publisher, Analyst) with shared task coordination via `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`.

**Files created** (1): `agents/marc_conversation.md`
**Files rewritten** (3): `agents/marc.md`, `agents/marc_pipeline.md`, `agents/marc_publishing.md`
**Files edited** (9): `agents/scout.md`, `agents/strategist.md`, `agents/creator.md`, `agents/publisher.md`, `agents/analyst.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/run_task.sh`, `scripts/run_pipeline.sh`, `scripts/telegram_bot.py`

**Key changes**:
- `agents/marc.md`: Rewritten as Team Leader (spawns teammates via Agent tool instead of nested `claude -p`)
- `agents/marc_conversation.md`: New system prompt for conversational Marc (identity, team reference, decision rules, START_TASK tool)
- `agents/marc_pipeline.md`: Transformed from 13 rigid steps to goal-oriented playbook with parallel teammate spawning
- `agents/marc_publishing.md`: Transformed from P1-P8 steps to goal-oriented playbook with teammate spawning
- All 5 agent skill files: Added "Teammate Mode" section for autonomous operation when spawned as teammates
- `scripts/telegram_bot.py`: Major rewrite (~645→~910 lines) — added conversational layer via `claude -p`, `_execute_task()` spawner, default text handler, `/pipeline` command, `/running` command
- `scripts/run_task.sh` + `run_pipeline.sh`: Added `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` env var, updated prompts for Team Leader role
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added Architecture section describing two-layer design

**Issues encountered & resolved**:
1. Anthropic API key not available → switched conversational layer from Anthropic API to `claude -p` (uses Max subscription)
2. `--no-input` flag doesn't exist in claude CLI → removed invalid flag

**Result**: Marc responds conversationally via Telegram, spawns Agent Teams for execution.

### Session 25 — Production Testing: First Real Task Execution + Pipeline Run (March 6-7, 2026)

**Goal**: Test the agent system end-to-end with real tasks via Telegram — verify Marc can receive tasks, reason about them, spawn teammates, and deliver results autonomously.

**Tasks Executed** (5 total, via Telegram → Marc):

| Task | Type | Duration | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | Ad-hoc (competitor strategy) | 47s | Failed — no output (silent completion) |
| 002 | Ad-hoc (retry of 001) | 73s | Failed — same issue |
| 003 | Ad-hoc (retry after fix) | 10m | **Success** — 456KB scout report + 86KB HTML strategy report |
| 004 | Ad-hoc (competitor image analysis) | 2.5m | **Success** — 60KB image analysis JSON with real media URLs |
| 005 | Daily pipeline | 10m | **Success** — Full pipeline completed, all validations passed, War Room 100/100 |

**Critical Bug Found & Fixed — Non-Interactive Execution**:
- **Symptom**: Tasks 001-002 completed with exit_code 0 but produced no output files (47s/73s — too fast)
- **Root cause**: Two issues combined:
  1. `telegram_bot.py`'s `_execute_task()` was missing the non-interactive instruction that `run_task.sh` already had
  2. `CLAUDE.md`'s "Don't try to run scripts with bash tool" preference was not scoped — applied in non-interactive mode where the operator isn't watching
- **Fix 1**: Added `IMPORTANT: You are running in non-interactive mode. Execute ALL scripts directly...` to `_execute_task()` prompt in `telegram_bot.py`
- **Fix 2**: Scoped CLAUDE.md preferences to differentiate interactive vs non-interactive sessions

**Image/Media Data Collection Added**:
- **Problem**: Scout collected `profile_image_url` via API but discarded it; tweet media (photos/videos) not collected at all
- **Fix**: Added `MEDIA_FIELDS` and `expansions=["attachments.media_keys"]` to `x_api.py`'s `get_user_timeline()`, added `profile_image_url` to `scout.py`'s competitor output
- **Cost**: Zero additional API calls — expansions are free data in the same response
- **Verified**: Task 004 produced image analysis with real `pbs.twimg.com` URLs for all image posts

**Pipeline Issue — Creator `status: "approved"` instead of `"draft"`**:
- **Symptom**: Task 005 content plans had all posts as `status: "approved"`, bypassing the human approval gate
- **Root cause**: Creator agent didn't follow its own validation rule #6. Marc didn't catch it because he validated by reasoning instead of running `validate.py`
- **Fix**: Added explicit `status: "draft"` reminder in `creator.md` (Step 2) and in `marc_pipeline.md` Creator spawn prompts

**Agent Philosophy Established**:
- Marc operates like a **human agent with SOP**: daily/repetitive tasks follow the SOP (pipeline playbook) faithfully including running validation scripts; ad-hoc tasks require free reasoning where Marc decides his own approach
- Marc decides which mode applies — "Is this a daily pipeline → follow SOP" vs "Is this ad-hoc → think freely"
- Scripts like `validate.py` are **tools Marc uses**, not robotic steps — they serve Marc's reasoning, not replace it

**Files modified** (5):
- `scripts/telegram_bot.py` — Added non-interactive override to `_execute_task()`
- `CLAUDE.md` — Scoped preferences for interactive vs non-interactive sessions
- `scripts/x_api.py` — Added `MEDIA_FIELDS`, media expansions to `get_user_timeline()`, media lookup from response includes
- `scripts/scout.py` — Added `profile_image_url` to `fetch_competitor()` return dict
- `agents/creator.md` — Added bold `status: "draft"` reminder at Step 2
- `agents/marc_pipeline.md` — Added `status: "draft"` instruction to Creator spawn prompts

**Key outputs produced** (verified end-to-end, later cleaned up in Session 27):
- `data/scout_report_20260306.json` (538KB) — 41 competitors with media data
- `data/strategy_report_20260306.html` (86KB) — Professional HTML report with competitor analysis + EN/JP strategies
- `data/image_analysis_report_20260306.json` (60KB) — Image post analysis with real URLs, category performance, engagement comparison
- `data/strategy_20260306.json` (7.6KB) — Daily strategy with data-driven insights
- `data/content_plan_20260306_EN.json` + `_JP.json` — 4 posts each with image prompts, A/B test variants, reply templates
- `data/pipeline_state_20260306.json` — Full pipeline state, all tasks completed

### Session 26 — HTML Report Generation for Telegram Review (March 7, 2026)

**Goal**: Generate HTML versions of all reports Marc sends to Telegram, so the operator can review them in a mobile browser instead of reading truncated JSON in chat.

**Problem**: Telegram's 4096 character limit truncates inline previews. JSON files are hard to read on mobile. The strategy report HTML from task 003 (86KB, dark theme) proved HTML works well for review.

**Solution**: Created `scripts/generate_html_report.py` with 3 report types:

| Report Type | CLI Command | JSON Input | HTML Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `content_preview` | `generate_html_report.py content_preview <EN> <JP> --strategy <path> [--pipeline-state <path>]` | Content plans + strategy + pipeline state | `data/content_preview_{date}.html` |
| `daily_report` | `generate_html_report.py daily_report <report.json>` | Daily report JSON | `data/daily_report_{date}.html` |
| `publish_report` | `generate_html_report.py publish_report <EN> <JP> [--outbound-log <path>] [--rate-limits <path>]` | Content plans (posted) + outbound log + rate limits | `data/publish_report_{date}.html` |

**Design**: Reuses CSS design system from the Session 25 strategy report (dark theme, cards, stat boxes, tags, bar charts, responsive). Standard library only — no external dependencies.

**HTML reports are read-only visualization** — they consume existing JSON, never create or modify it. Agents continue to produce and consume JSON; HTML is purely for human review on mobile.

**Files created/modified** (3):
- `scripts/generate_html_report.py` — **New** HTML report generator (~550 lines, 3 report types)
- `agents/marc_pipeline.md` — Step 9 updated: generates `content_preview_{date}.html` and sends via `telegram_send.py --document`
- `agents/marc_publishing.md` — Steps 4 and 8 updated: generates `publish_report_{date}.html` and `daily_report_{date}.html`

**Verified**: Content preview (31KB) and daily report (22KB) generated from existing March 6 data and opened in browser.

### Session 27 — Remove Mar 6 Pipeline Test Output (March 7, 2026)

**Goal**: Clean up test output files from the Mar 6 pipeline run (Session 25, task 005) now that end-to-end verification is complete.

**Rationale**: The Mar 6 pipeline was a production test to verify the system works. With that confirmed, the test output is no longer needed and was cluttering the `data/` directory. Mar 3-5 data (earlier test runs) is retained.

**Files removed** (11):
- `data/content_plan_20260306_EN.json` — Test content plan (EN)
- `data/content_plan_20260306_JP.json` — Test content plan (JP)
- `data/content_preview_20260306.html` — Session 26 HTML report derived from Mar 6 test data
- `data/image_analysis_report_20260306.json` — Image analysis from test run
- `data/pipeline_state_20260306.json` — Pipeline state from test run
- `data/scout_compact_20260306.json` — Compact scout data
- `data/scout_raw_20260306.json` — Raw scout data
- `data/scout_report_20260306.json` — Enriched scout report
- `data/strategy_20260306.json` — Strategy from test run
- `data/strategy_report_20260306.html` — Strategy HTML report from test run
- `data/strategy_current.json` — Copy of strategy_20260306.json (will regenerate on next real pipeline run)

**Note**: No posts were published to X from the Mar 6 pipeline — all posts stayed at `approved` status locally, so no X API cleanup was needed.

### Session 28 — URL Reading for Conversational Marc (March 7, 2026)

**Goal**: Enable Marc to read web page content when the operator shares URLs via Telegram.

**Problem**: When the operator shared a URL in Telegram, Marc only saw the raw URL text — he couldn't read the content behind it. This prevented the operator from sharing articles, references, or competitor pages for Marc to analyze.

**Solution**: Added automatic URL detection and content fetching in the Telegram bot's message handler. When a message contains URLs, the bot fetches each page's content and appends it to the message before sending to Marc.

**How it works**:
1. `handle_message` detects URLs in incoming text (regex, up to 3 URLs per message)
2. Fetches each URL via `scripts/fetch_url.py` (async via executor to avoid blocking)
3. Appends extracted text between `--- Content from <url> ---` markers
4. Marc receives the enriched message and can reason about the page content

**Files created/modified** (3):
- `scripts/fetch_url.py` — **New** URL fetcher using `requests` + stdlib `html.parser` (~100 lines). Extracts readable text from HTML, handles plain text/JSON directly. Truncates at 5000 chars. Also works as CLI.
- `scripts/telegram_bot.py` — Added `_extract_urls()`, `_fetch_url_content()`, `_enrich_message_with_urls()` helpers; modified `handle_message` to enrich messages with URL content before sending to Marc
- `agents/marc_conversation.md` — Added "URL Reading" section documenting the content markers and how to use fetched content

### Session 29 — Competitor Image Analysis Pipeline + Higgsfield Prompt Upgrade (March 8, 2026)

**Goal**: (1) Give Creator visual intelligence by analyzing top competitor images via Claude Vision. (2) Upgrade all content plan image prompts to full Higgsfield schema. (3) Show structured prompt fields in HTML preview with one-click copy.

**Problem**: Scout collects media URLs but Creator had zero insight into competitor visuals. Existing content plan prompts used old midjourney/stable_diffusion format (short generic text, no structured fields). HTML preview only showed flat prompt text — structured fields were invisible and required per-section copy-paste.

**Solution**:
1. New `image_analyzer.py` script — reads scout report, picks top 5 images by likes, calls Anthropic Vision API (Claude Sonnet), outputs Higgsfield-format references + visual patterns summary to `data/image_references_{YYYYMMDD}.json`. Creator uses these as (a) pattern awareness and (b) per-post style matching.
2. Rewrote all 4 content plan image prompts (EN_01, EN_02, JP_01, JP_02) to full Higgsfield schema: 150+ word prompts, standard negative prompts, all structured fields (meta, subject, outfit, pose, scene, camera, lighting, mood), locked character profiles.
3. Updated HTML report generator to render structured fields as syntax-highlighted JSON with "Copy JSON" button — one click copies the entire image_prompt object.

**Character profile compliance review**: Fixed 3 issues found during review:
- EN body_type was missing "curvaceous" from locked profile → added
- JP body_type used generic "full curves" instead of locked "large full chest, slim waist, wide full hips" → fixed
- EN_01 skin had unlocked "light warm tan" addition → removed

**Pipeline integration**: Image analysis added as Step 3.5 (optional — pipeline continues on failure).

**Files created/modified** (7):
- `scripts/image_analyzer.py` — **New** (~300 lines). Vision API analysis, `--top N`, `--dry-run`, rate limit retry, structured output.
- `agents/creator.md` — Added image references input step #5, "Using Image References" section (2 modes)
- `agents/marc_pipeline.md` — Added Step 3.5, updated dependency diagram and Creator spawn prompts
- `scripts/validate.py` — Added `image_references` validation mode (6 checks)
- `scripts/generate_html_report.py` — Structured Higgsfield fields rendered as syntax-highlighted JSON block with "Copy JSON" button
- `data/content_plan_20260308_EN.json` — Full Higgsfield rewrite (was midjourney)
- `data/content_plan_20260308_JP.json` — Full Higgsfield rewrite (was stable_diffusion)

**Verification**: Dry-run found 206 images, analyzed top 5 with mock data, validator passed 6/6 checks. Content plan validator passed 12/12 checks for both EN and JP. Character profile review passed all checks after fixes.

### Session 30 — Outbound Agent: Separate Engagement from Publishing (March 8, 2026)

**Goal**: Extract outbound engagement (likes, replies, follows) from Publisher into a dedicated Outbound agent with safety reasoning, cooldown enforcement, and history awareness.

**Problem**: Publisher owned both posting (mechanical script execution) and outbound planning (strategic reasoning about who to engage, what to say, when to hold back). These are fundamentally different jobs. Posting is deterministic; outbound requires safety reasoning, cooldown checks, and contextual reply crafting.

**Solution**: Created a new **Outbound agent** that owns the full outbound engagement lifecycle. Publisher stays lean for posting only. The Outbound agent adds safety layers that the old Publisher Smart Outbound Mode lacked:
1. **History awareness** — queries SQLite + JSON logs for past engagement before planning
2. **Cooldown enforcement** — 7-day follow, 3-day reply, 2-day like cooldowns per target
3. **Follow deduplication** — never re-follows already-followed accounts
4. **Tweet deduplication** — never re-likes already-liked tweets
5. **Volume budgets** — conservative safety margins below global API limits (EN: 20 likes, 5 replies, 3 follows; JP: 15 likes, 5 replies, 2 follows)
6. **Target rotation** — Strategist now rotates targets from the full 31+ competitor pool

**Architecture change**:
```
Before: Strategist → strategy.json → Publisher (plans + executes outbound)
After:  Strategist → strategy.json → Outbound agent (plans with safety reasoning) → publisher.py smart-outbound (executes)
```

**Files created** (3):
- `agents/outbound.md` — Full agent definition with 6-step workflow (read inputs → safety reasoning → fetch targets → analyze/plan → write plan → execute)
- `scripts/outbound_history.py` — History query tool; reads from SQLite + JSON logs; outputs human-readable summaries with per-target engagement counts, follow status, liked tweet IDs, and budget usage. Three CLI modes: `--days N`, `--target @handle`, `--check-tweets "id1,id2"`
- `config/outbound_rules.json` — Safety parameters (margins per account, cooldown periods, target rotation rules)

**Files modified** (7):
- `agents/publisher.md` — Removed Smart Outbound Mode section, added brief execution-only note pointing to Outbound agent
- `agents/strategist.md` — Added Target Rotation Rules subsection (draw from full pool, check recent logs, market matching, mix sizes, target count per account)
- `agents/marc_publishing.md` — Step 3 now spawns Outbound agent instead of Publisher; error recovery updated
- `agents/marc.md` — Updated team table, publishing flow, logging agents, dependencies
- `agents/marc_conversation.md` — Updated team table and task types to separate Publisher/Outbound
- `agents/creator.md` — Reply templates now reference Outbound agent
- `CLAUDE.md` — Added Outbound to agent definitions and tool assignments

**Verification**: Python syntax check passed. JSON validation passed. All 3 CLI modes of `outbound_history.py` tested against live data (EN: 54 actions across 5 targets found; JP: no history, fresh-run path verified; tweet dedup correctly identifies already-liked tweets). Cross-reference check found and fixed 2 additional stale references in `marc_conversation.md` and `creator.md`.

### Session 32 — First Production Outbound: OAuth Fix, Follow Verification, Agent Escalation Pattern (March 9, 2026)

**Goal**: Execute the first production outbound engagement run for EN (@meruru_tcbn sub-account) using the full Outbound agent workflow built in Session 30.

**Problem 1 — Wrong OAuth tokens**: All accounts in `config/accounts.json` shared the same `access_token` (prefix `777944572160724996-`), which belonged to the app owner's personal account — not @meruru_tcbn (`1962081689238491136`). The X API returned success for likes/follows/replies, but actions were applied to the wrong account. No activity appeared on @meruru_tcbn.

**Fix**: Ran PIN-based OAuth 1.0a 3-legged flow (`tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler` with `callback='oob'`) while logged into X as @meruru_tcbn. Generated new tokens with correct prefix `1962081689238491136-`. Updated EN and EN-subaccount entries in `config/accounts.json`.

**Verification method**: To confirm follows actually work, the system must query the authenticated user's following list via API (`client.get_users_following` with bearer token) rather than trusting the follow API's success response. Tested by following @JosephinaM3131 (confirmed not in following list), then re-querying — following count went from 22 to 23 with the account present.

**Problem 2 — Reply 403 restriction**: All reply attempts failed with `"Reply to this conversation is not allowed because you have not been mentioned or otherwise engaged by the author"`. This is an X platform restriction on newer/low-follower accounts, not a credentials issue.

**Problem 3 — Agent philosophy gap**: The original implementation just logged reply failures and stopped. The operator's feedback: *"An agent should think autonomously and make every effort to achieve the goal. If it can't reply via API, it should ask a human to reply — specifying which account, which post, and what text."* Reporting a blocker and stopping is script behavior, not agent behavior.

**Solution**: Implemented a **failed action escalation pattern** — when API actions fail, the system collects them with exact actionable instructions (tweet URL + reply text) for the human operator to complete manually.

**Production results** (2 outbound rounds):

| Action | Round 1 (API) | Round 2 (API) | Manual | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Likes | 12 | 8 | — | 20 |
| Follows | 3 | 1 | — | 4 (+1 test) |
| Replies | 0 (all 403) | 0 (403) | 5 | 5 |

Accounts engaged: @Angelwithcakee, @yogana_19, @IvoryLane_plus, @HannaJonso (Round 1), @IsabellaCruz_47, @Estherbron1 (Round 2), @JosephinaM3131 (test follow kept).

**Files modified** (4):
- `config/accounts.json` — EN and EN-subaccount tokens updated to @meruru_tcbn's OAuth tokens
- `scripts/publisher.py` — Smart-outbound reply failure now tracks `failed_replies` array in outbound log with tweet URL and reply text for human escalation
- `agents/outbound.md` — Added Step 7: after execution, check `failed_replies` and escalate to Marc with actionable instructions for manual posting
- `agents/marc_publishing.md` — After outbound, check outbound log for `failed_replies` and send Telegram message with manual reply instructions

**Rules added** (1):
- `config/global_rules.md` — "When an API action fails, don't just report and stop — find an alternative path. Agents think and adapt; scripts just fail."

**Key lesson**: The distinction between an agent and a script is not the technology — it's the behavior when blocked. A script fails and reports. An agent reasons about alternatives and finds a path to the goal, even if that path involves escalating to a human with exact instructions.

**Also in this session — Telegram Image Support Fix**:

The operator shared an AI-generated image via Telegram with a caption asking Marc to evaluate it. The bot's `handle_photo` function failed with `"error: unknown option '-a'"` — it was using a non-existent `-a` flag on `claude -p` and was hardcoded to only parse metrics screenshots.

**Fix**: Rewrote `handle_photo` to route images through conversational Marc via `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions`. The image is saved locally and its path is embedded in the prompt so Claude reads it via the Read tool (which supports images). The caption becomes the user's message. This uses the same Max subscription auth as the text conversation — no API key needed.

**Additional file modified** (1):
- `scripts/telegram_bot.py` — `handle_photo` rewritten: general-purpose image + caption → conversational Marc (was: hardcoded metrics screenshot parser with broken `-a` flag)

### Session 33 — Third Outbound Run + Scheduling Architecture Decision (March 10-11, 2026)

**Goal**: Run daily outbound engagement for EN, evaluate Claude Code's new scheduled tasks feature for pipeline scheduling.

**Outbound run (Round 3)**: Used strategy from `data/strategy_20260309.json` with 4 targets: @tanarainw (191K), @iiCoraMaay (17.8K), @baharaykin (12.6K), @NotjustRen00 (16.7K).

Before planning, verified @meruru_tcbn's actual following list via bearer token API (`get_users_following`) — found 3 of 4 targets already followed (likely manually by operator), only @baharaykin not followed. This programmatic check prevented wasting 3 follow attempts.

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Likes | 12/12 succeeded |
| Follows | 1/1 succeeded (@baharaykin) |
| Replies | 0/4 (all 403 — reply restriction still active on new account) |

Failed replies escalated to operator with tweet URLs and reply text per the escalation pattern established in Session 32.

**Files created** (2):
- `data/outbound_plan_20260310_EN.json` — Outbound plan with safety checks (API-verified follow status)
- `data/outbound_log_20260310.json` — Execution log with 4 `failed_replies` entries

**Scheduling architecture decision**: Evaluated Claude Code's new scheduled tasks feature (`/loop` CLI and Desktop Scheduled Tasks) against system cron for our pipeline scheduling needs.

- **CLI `/loop`**: Session-scoped (dies on exit), 3-day auto-expiry. Not viable for unattended operation.
- **Desktop Scheduled Tasks**: Persistent, catches up missed runs, but requires Desktop GUI app open + computer awake. Agent teams explicitly not available in Desktop.
- **System cron**: Fully headless, survives restarts, proven reliability.

**Decision**: System cron remains the right choice. Claude Code's scheduling features are designed for developer-in-the-loop workflows (build polling, PR monitoring), not unattended agent pipelines. Our Telegram bot daemon + cron (or Python APScheduler inside the bot) provides the reliability our system needs.

**Model assignment per agent**: Previously all agents ran on Opus (inherited from parent). Implemented cost-optimized model selection:

| Agent | Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Marc (team leader + conversation) | **Opus** | Complex coordination, judgment, multi-step reasoning |
| Scout | **Sonnet** | Structured data analysis and pattern detection |
| Strategist | **Sonnet** | Strategy development — strong reasoning, doesn't need Opus |
| Creator | **Sonnet** | Creative writing + structured JSON output |
| Outbound | **Sonnet** | Safety reasoning + contextual reply crafting |
| Analyst | **Haiku** | Structured data summarization — lightest task |
| Publisher | — | Script only, no LLM |

**Files modified** (5):
- `agents/marc.md` — Agent team table with model column + rationale
- `agents/marc_pipeline.md` — Scout (sonnet), Strategist (sonnet), Creator (sonnet) spawn prompts
- `agents/marc_publishing.md` — Outbound (sonnet), Analyst (haiku) spawn prompts
- `agents/marc_conversation.md` — Team table with model column
- `CLAUDE.md` — Agent definitions with model annotations

---

## 4. Decision Summary

### Framework-Level Decisions (Apply to All Future Projects)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Claude Code + cron as the agent execution framework | Handles 80% natively; cron fills scheduling gap; avoids dependency on OpenClaw |
| D2 | VPS for always-on compute (Phase 6 deployment) | Cheaper than hardware ($12/mo Vultr Tokyo); only needed for autonomous operation |
| D3 | Telegram Bot for human-agent communication | Simple (~50 lines Python), free, feature-rich; universal across any project |
| D8 | CLAUDE.md for persistent behavioral memory | Native auto-loading; rules persist across sessions; no custom code needed |
| D16 | Agent Teams for multi-agent coordination | Enables shared task lists, teammate messaging, and parallel execution — replacing isolated `claude -p` subagents |

### Demo-Specific Decisions (X Beauty Project)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D4 | X API Basic + Playwright hybrid | Official API for safety ($200/mo); Playwright only for impressions. ⚠️ Playwright may be removed per compliance review |
| D5 | Marc (COO) as orchestrator agent | Implements hierarchical coordination principle from article |
| D6 | Merge Reporter into Marc (7→6 agents) | COO already holds full context; separate Reporter loses judgment |
| D7 | English docs with JP terms preserved | Operator preference |
| D9 | Separate PRD + Technical Spec | Config = spec (how); PRD = product layer (why, success criteria) |
| D10 | Local-first development; VPS deferred to Phase 6 | VPS only needed for autonomous operation; development uses your own machine + CLI |
| D11 | Log compliance concerns, resolve during implementation | Avoids premature spec changes; each issue reviewed at relevant phase |
| D12 | Accept X Terms risks for likes/follows/replies/Playwright | Risk accepted for all 4 critical compliance issues — implement with awareness; monitor for enforcement changes |
| D13 | Git + GitHub at Phase 0 completion | Version control established before agent development; private repo with secrets excluded via `.gitignore` |
| D14 | Marc as Claude agent + `validate.py` + `run_pipeline.sh` | Orchestration = judgment (Claude's strength); deterministic checks = Python; avoids Phase 2 rewrite |
| D15 | Marc is sole writer of `strategy_current.json` | Prevents unvalidated Strategist output from corrupting the current strategy file |

**Key principles** (from the original article, validated and refined):

1. **Single-responsibility agents** — each agent does one thing well
2. **Hierarchical coordination via COO** — one agent orchestrates all others and owns human communication
3. **Cron-triggered batch pipelines** — overnight execution, no always-listening daemon needed
4. **Persistent memory via CLAUDE.md** — behavioral rules auto-loaded; learned knowledge persists
5. **Filesystem-based shared state** — agents communicate via JSON/SQLite, not in-memory
6. **Human-in-the-loop at decision points** — approval gates before irreversible actions
7. **Error handling with classification** — auto-retry vs. escalate vs. halt based on error type
8. **Telegram as the single communication channel** — reports, alerts, commands, all unified
9. **Hybrid agents ("Claude Brain, Python Hands")** — Agents that need both deterministic execution (API calls, rate limits, data storage) AND reasoning (analysis, filtering, composition) use a hybrid pattern: Python handles execution, Claude handles intelligence. Failures degrade gracefully to Python-only behavior.
10. **Agent Teams with shared coordination** — Agents operate as teammates with shared task lists and messaging, enabling parallel execution and iterative collaboration. The conversational layer (lightweight `claude -p`) handles task intake; the execution layer (Agent Teams) handles the work.

#### 6.1.1 Hybrid Agent Pattern (Phase 5) + Agent Teams (Session 24)

Four agents operate as "Claude Brain, Python Hands" hybrids. Python scripts handle all API calls, rate limiting, and data storage. Claude subagents add intelligence: anomaly detection (Analyst), reply filtering & executive summaries (Scout), contextual engagement planning with safety reasoning (Outbound). If Claude fails, each agent falls back to Phase 4 Python-only behavior. Post publishing remains Python-only via Publisher (safety-critical, human-gated). Outbound engagement was extracted from Publisher into a dedicated Outbound agent (Session 30) to add safety layers: cooldown enforcement, follow/tweet deduplication, and history-aware volume budgets. See `docs/specs/phase-5-spec.md` §4.1 for the original pattern.

As of Session 24, all agents operate as **teammates** within Claude Code Agent Teams. Marc spawns them via the Agent tool with shared task lists and messaging. This adds a coordination layer on top of the hybrid pattern — agents can now work in parallel (e.g., Creator EN + JP simultaneously), message each other, and claim tasks from a shared list. The conversational layer (Conversational Marc via `claude -p`) handles task intake and reasoning before spawning the heavier Agent Teams execution layer.

### 6.2 Key Details

- **Goal**: 0 → 10,000 followers on at least one account (EN or JP)
- **Tech stack**: Claude Code CLI + cron + X API v2 (Basic $200/mo) + Playwright (under compliance review) + python-telegram-bot + SQLite + CLAUDE.md
- **Monthly cost**: ~$227-245/month (X API $200, Claude subagent tokens ~$27-45). Vultr VPS ($12/mo) added at Phase 6 deployment.
- **Daily pipeline**: 0:30 AM pipeline start → 7:00 AM morning brief → 7-9 AM human approval → 9 AM-9 PM posting & engagement → 11 PM metrics → 11:30 PM daily report → 11:45 PM retrospective
- **Estimated timeline**: ~22 days from Phase 0 start to autonomous operation (Phases 0-5 local development, Phase 6 VPS deployment, Phase 7 autonomous). Updated from ~19 days after Phase 5 (Claude Hybrid Agent Conversion) was added.

## 9. Implementation Status

### Development Approach

All development happens on your own machine. A VPS is only needed when the system is ready to run autonomously. Phases 0-5 are local CLI development. Phase 6 is VPS deployment. Phase 7 is autonomous operation.

**Latest**: Session 33 — Third outbound run + scheduling decision + model assignment (March 10-11, 2026). 12 likes + 1 follow succeeded, 4 replies failed (escalated). Cron confirmed over Claude Code scheduled tasks. Implemented per-agent model selection: Marc on Opus, teammates on Sonnet, Analyst on Haiku.

## 10. Key Technical Decisions Explained

### Why Claude Code + cron instead of OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a daemon-based framework with native messaging and always-listening capabilities. Claude Code is a session-based CLI tool. Despite this, Claude Code was chosen because: (a) it handles ~80% of requirements natively, (b) cron fills the scheduling gap reliably, (c) a 50-line Telegram bot fills the messaging gap, (d) staying within Anthropic's ecosystem avoids the security risks of OpenClaw's broad permissions and community skill vulnerabilities, (e) it avoids learning a second framework. The key insight was that the project needs a batch pipeline (run overnight, review in morning), not a real-time conversational daemon.

### Why a COO agent (Marc) instead of a simple orchestrator script?

A shell script can handle sequencing (run A, then B, then C) and basic error handling (retry on failure). But it cannot make judgment calls: "Creator produced 3 posts but Strategist said 4 — should I ask Creator to regenerate or adjust the strategy?" "Follower count dropped 15% — is this a data error, a shadowban, or normal variance?" These require the reasoning capability of an LLM. Marc is the layer where orchestration meets judgment.

### Why X API + Playwright hybrid for the demo?

Pure X API (Basic, $200/month) cannot provide impression counts — that requires Pro at $5,000/month. Pure Playwright risks account bans. The hybrid uses official API for everything except impression scraping from own post pages — minimal risk, full functionality, $200/month. **Note**: Compliance review (Session 10) found that Playwright scraping — even on own pages — may violate X's ban on non-API automation of the website. This will be re-evaluated at Phase 4; Playwright may be removed entirely.

### Why CLAUDE.md instead of a database for agent memory?

CLAUDE.md files are automatically loaded by Claude Code at session start with zero custom code. For behavioral instructions ("never use more than 3 hashtags"), this is ideal. Structured data (metrics, rate limits, credentials) stays in JSON/SQLite because Python scripts need machine-parseable formats. This split — CLAUDE.md for behavior, JSON/SQLite for data — is a reusable pattern for any project using this framework.

### Why 6 agents for the demo instead of fewer or more?

Each agent maps to a distinct skill domain. Combining any two would bloat context windows. Splitting further would add coordination overhead without benefit. The COO-over-specialists pattern matches the original article's architecture and scales well — adding a new capability means adding one agent, not restructuring the whole system.

### Why Agent Teams instead of isolated subagents?

The original architecture spawned each agent as an isolated `claude -p` subprocess. Agents couldn't communicate, share task state, or work in parallel. Agent Teams (experimental feature) enables shared task lists, teammate messaging, and parallel execution — Creator EN and JP can now run simultaneously. The trade-off is dependency on an experimental feature, mitigated by keeping `run_task.sh` and `run_pipeline.sh` as fallback entry points.

### Why `claude -p` for the conversational layer instead of Anthropic API?

The operator subscribes to Claude Max ($100/mo) which includes unlimited `claude` CLI usage. Using the Anthropic API would require a separate API key and billing. Since the conversational layer only needs text-in/text-out (no streaming, no complex tool use), `claude -p` provides the same capability at zero additional cost. The conversation uses a `START_TASK:` JSON marker pattern to signal when Marc decides to execute, replacing the Anthropic API's native tool_use mechanism.

| **Analyst** | Demo agent: collects post metrics via X API batch lookup, account snapshots, stores in SQLite, generates JSON summaries. Manual impression input via Telegram /metrics, screenshot parsing (Claude Vision), or CSV/JSON import. |
| **War Room** | Marc's daily review session where all agent outputs are cross-checked for consistency |
| **Pipeline** | The agent execution sequence — during development, triggered manually via CLI; in production, triggered by cron overnight |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Claude Code's native memory system — markdown files auto-loaded at session start |
| **Orchestrator Script** | Shell script that cron triggers; launches Marc who then invokes agents in sequence |
| **Shared State** | The filesystem layer (JSON + SQLite) through which agents exchange data between sessions |
| **OpenClaw** | Open-source agent framework evaluated and rejected in favor of Claude Code + cron |
| **Compliance Review** | Living document tracking 7 X Developer Terms issues to resolve during implementation |
| **Amarry Technologies** | Shimpei's company — the broader corporate context |
| **UniModel** | Amarry's primary product — an AI model marketplace (separate from this project) |
| **Agent Teams** | Claude Code experimental feature enabling multi-agent coordination with shared task lists, teammate messaging, and parallel execution |
| **Teammate** | An agent spawned by Marc via the Agent tool within an Agent Teams session — can claim tasks, message other teammates, and work in parallel |
| **Conversational Layer** | The lightweight `claude -p` layer that handles Telegram message intake, reasoning, and task routing before spawning the heavier execution layer |
| **Execution Layer** | The Agent Teams session where Marc as Team Leader spawns teammates to do the actual work (Scout, Strategist, Creator, Publisher, Analyst) |
| **START_TASK marker** | Text-based protocol (`START_TASK:{json}`) used by conversational Marc to signal that a task should be executed via the Agent Teams execution layer |
